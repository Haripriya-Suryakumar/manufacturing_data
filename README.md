Power BI dashboard for visualizing production and quality metrics from a Kaggle dataset.
Manufacturing Efficiency Dashboard using Power BI

This project presents an interactive dashboard developed in Microsoft Power BI, designed to analyze key metrics from a manufacturing dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dashboard offers insights into production performance, downtime, quality control, and shift-level efficiency.

## Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes the following columns:
- Production ID  
- Date  
- Product Type  
- Machine ID  
- Shift  
- Units Produced  
- Defects  
- Production Time (Hours)  
- Material Cost Per Unit  
- Labour Cost Per Hour  
- Energy Consumption (kWh)  
- Operator Count  
- Maintenance Hours  
- Downtime Hours  
- Production Volume (Cubic Meters)  
- Scrap Rate  
- Rework Hours  
- Quality Checks Failed  
- Average Temperature (Â°C)  
- Average Humidity (%)  

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- Microsoft Power BI  
- DAX for custom calculations  
- Kaggle (CSV file dataset)

## Dashboard Insights:
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- KPI cards for total production and downtime  
- Charts for shift-wise production and defect breakdown  
- Trend lines for monitoring performance over time  
- Gauge visuals for measuring production targets  
- Visual storytelling for operational decision-making

## How to Open:
1. Download the `.pbix` file from this repository  
2. Open it using Power BI Desktop  
3. View and interact with the visuals
